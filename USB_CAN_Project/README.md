# USB-CAN Converter Project

## Project Overview
This project simulates a USB-CAN converter for light motor vehicles (LMVs). It includes both Python simulations and embedded C firmware.

## Directory Structure
- `python_simulation/`: Python scripts for emulation and testing.
- `embedded_firmware/`: Embedded C code for the microcontroller.
- `tests/`: Test cases for validation.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for development.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and diagrams.

## Running the Simulations
To run the simulations, navigate to the `python_simulation` directory and execute the desired script.
